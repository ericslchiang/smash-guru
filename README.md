# Motivation
Smash Guru tries to predict the placings of a smash tournament based on
historical player head-to-head records and the relative competitiveness for
a tournament.

# How to Run
Call `run.sh` with a tournament name and the relevant smash event. For example:
```
$ ./run.sh get-on-my-level-2016 melee-singles
```
